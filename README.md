# 👋 Hello, World!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! If you're reading this, you're probably checking to see if I'm GitHub-friendly. Well, good news – I am! 😄

## 🚀 About Me

I started studying JS in May 2022. Prior to that, I was a professional online poker player, where the skills of constant learning and improvement were part of my daily routine. 
Since May, it has been an exciting and challenging journey, and I can't wait to share what I've accomplished since then.
