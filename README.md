👋 Hello!
## 🚀 About Me

I started studying JS in May 2022. Prior to that, I was a professional online poker player, where the skills of constant learning and improvement were part of my daily routine. 
Since May, it has been an exciting and challenging journey, and I can't wait to share what I've accomplished since then.

## 💼 My Projects

## 🌱 Open for Collaboration

## ❓ Need Feedback

If, for any reason, my profile or projects don't quite hit the mark, I'd genuinely appreciate any feedback. Constructive criticism helps me grow, and I'm open to learning.
